# Linguistic change in an online support group

This repository contains materials related to my PhD research, which involves identifying linguistic change over the course of membership in an online forum for bipolar disorder. These materials consist mostly of:

1. The thesis itself, in `.TeX` and `.pdf`
2. *Jupyter Notebooks* containing code used to generate findings
3. The dataset used for the thesis
4. Slides from presentations

The thesis relies extensively on *corpkit*, a purpose-built Python module, which is available via [GitHub](https://www.github.com/interrogator/corpkit) and [ReadtheDocs](http://corpkit.readthedocs.io).

## Working with Jupyter Notebooks

The *Jupyter Notebooks* in the `./notebooks` directory can be viewed online, or downloaded and run locally. If you clone the whole repository, it is possible to manipulate the data and code yourself.

The three notebooks correspond to three chapters in the thesis.

1. [Shallow features](https://github.com/interrogator/thesis/blob/master/notebooks/shallow-findings.ipynb)
2. [Mood features](https://github.com/interrogator/thesis/blob/master/notebooks/mood-findings.ipynb)
3. [Transitivity features](https://github.com/interrogator/thesis/blob/master/notebooks/transitivity-findings.ipynb)
