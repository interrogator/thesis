\chapter{Methods for investigating online health discourse} \label{chap:approaches}

%In the previous chapter, I synthesised literature concerning language use in \glspl{OSG}, understanding new and veteran users' contributions through in terms of legitimacy, and conceptualising longitudinal change in linguistic choice in terms of socialisation. Recent computational approaches to analysis of \gls{OSG} were also surveyed. A gap in knowledge was described: qualitative approaches \gls{OSG} discourse have issued regarding reproducibility and generalisability, and few relate analysed texts to the linguistic system and social context in reliable, transparent way. Meanwhile, computational studies have involved a simplification of how language works, ignoring the role of grammar and context in the meaning\hyp{}making process. This chapter begins by proposing \gls{CL} and \gls{CADS} as potential approaches to analysing \glspl{OSG} quantitatively and semi-automatically, as linguistic \glspl{corpus}. Next, it proposes \gls{SFL} as a linguistic framework for mapping wordings to meanings, distinguishing between interpersonal and experiential functions of language, and unpacking the generic structure of texts.

%Outside of the context of online health support groups, the possibilities are broader still: \gls{CMC} data can inform the development of grammars based on attested usage in large \gls{CMC} \glspl{corpus} \cite{gries_corpus_2011}, or be used to quantify public sentiment about a person, thing or event over time \cite[see][]{denecke_sentiment_2015}. 
%At the same time, valuable things can be performed through \gls{CMC}: \gls{CMC} is commonly used as a language pedagogy platform; \gls{CMC} can disseminate information during catastrophic events.

%As the largest repository of searchable text and metadata collections, the Web represents a dataset with unlimited potential for exploitation. Compared to manual collection of face\hyp{}to\hyp{}face data, \gls{CMC} data collection is almost always cheaper, faster and easier to reproduce. This is especially the case in comparison to healthcare contexts, where ethics approval may be a lengthy process, and where access to consenting patients may be sporadic \cite{yao_impact_2015}. Moreover, because \gls{CMC} is \emph{born-digital}, it can be processed automatically, making methods scalable and simplifying the process of applying developed methods to new data \cite{androutsopoulos_online_2013}. %For these reasons, the Web and \gls{CMC} occupy a large space within linguistic research today.

The previous chapter established that valuable things can be learned through analysis of text\hyp{}based \gls{CMC}. These things can be both theoretical and appliable: in the context of this case study, this includes insights into the lived experience of people with illnesses, as well as emerging computational methods for identifying correlations language use and health outcomes. In this chapter, I shift attention to methods and theories of language that be used to understand and process online healthcare communication.

\section{Preconditions for useful online healthcare discourse research}

Almost any analysis of \gls{CMC} necessitates, on some level, extraction of information from natural language. As described in the previous chapter, this either takes place within a qualitatively oriented workflow, where \gls{CMC} data is sampled, and where one or more researchers hand\hyp{}code and manually analyse the data, or a quantitatively oriented workflow, where larger amounts of data are automatically processed. The former sacrifices speed and breadth for accuracy and depth of insight; the latter, being oriented toward the development of methods that can be automatically applied to unseen data, tends to obscure the role of context in meaning\hyp{}making. Because both qualitatively and quantitatively oriented approaches offer different kinds of insight into \gls{CMC}, mixed\hyp{}methods approaches that combine both paradigms have become steadily more popular in \gls{CMC} research, just as they have in linguistics more generally \cite{bolander2014doing}. Discourse\hyp{}analytic research, for example, has increasingly leveraged \gls{CL} methods, in order to make more reliable generalisations about meanings in larger collections of text \cite{baker2015corpus}.

Fruitful analysis of computer\hyp{}mediated discourse, therefore, requires two things: first are tools and methods that can be used to transform \gls{CMC} into analysable data, and then to analyse it; second is an accurate conceptualisation of how language works, so that words and wordings in a dataset can be connected to their meanings and functions in a reliable, systematic way. With this in mind, in the remainder of this chapter, I put forward \gls{SFL} and \gls{CL} as ways of addressing theoretical and methodological gaps in current knowledge about language use in \glspl{OSG}. The major practices of \gls{CL}, as well as criticism and needed improvements in these practices, are surveyed first. \gls{SFL} is then introduced as a framework suitable for analysing \gls{CMC} and health talk more generally. An argument is made that \gls{SFL} and \gls{CL} together provide benefits for analysis of \glspl{OSG}, including greater accuracy, reliability and scalability, and, overall, greater explanatory power.

\section[Chapter summary]{Summary: theories and methods for investigating online healthcare discourse}

The synthesis of literature presented in this and the previous chapter has involved four research domains:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Computer mediatec communication (CMC) as a Medium, and \glspl{forum} as a \gls{Mode}
	\item Healthcare communication (HC) as a Field
	\item Corpus linguistics (CL) as an approach for analysing digital linguistic data
	\item Systemic functional linguistics (SFL) as a framework for understanding language
\end{enumerate}
%
The argument made throughout the literature review is that by combining these areas, we can learn new things about online intra\hyp{}\gls{consumer} health discourse, as well as uncover new ways to learn things. Key claims from qualitative literature can be tested quantitatively with largely automatic \gls{CL} methods, and evidenced by translating observed discourses into their lexicogrammatical realisations. 

The next part of the thesis, which introduces the case study of a \gls{bipolar} \gls{OSG}, demonstrates the potentiality of combining \gls{CL} methods and \gls{SFL} theory for the analysis of \gls{CMC}. The systemic grammar and sophisticated corpus methods make possible nuanced kinds of corpus interrogation that differentiate interpersonal from experiential meaning\hyp{}making.

%In doing this, the divide between qualitative approaches to \gls{CMD} and quantitative approaches to improved healthcare through data mining can be bridged. Discourse can be brought into the purview of statistical approaches that have tended to focus on analysis of metadata; discourse\hyp{}oriented research can have more useful implications for real-world healthcare issues.


%\section{Chapter summary}

%In this chapter, I presented \gls{CL} as a possible approach to analysis of online health discourse, and \gls{SFL} as a means of understanding texts. From the synthesis of literature emerged the beginnings of a framework for repeatable, quantitative analysis of health discourse. In the next chapter, I operationalise the nascent framework through a case study of linguistic change in an \gls{OSG}.
