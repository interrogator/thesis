\begin{abstract}

\noindent Online support groups (OSGs) are popular sources of both health information and social support. Though early research into OSGs highlighted a concern that non\hyp{}expert members may give harmful advice, more recent studies have typically shown that engagement with OSGs can increase consumer satisfaction with the treatment process, enhance wellbeing, and ultimately improve health outcomes. OSGs are well\hyp{}researched within applied linguistics. Qualitative studies have focussed on member roles within OSGs, as well as the ways in which group members discursively construct their identities, especially with respect to their illness. These approaches have generated rich insights into consumer healthcare discourse that can inform strategies for fostering consumer\hyp{}centred care. Qualitative approaches, however, are resource\hyp{}intensive, difficult to reproduce, and limited in terms of generalisability and representativeness. Quantitative and computational approaches are able to overcome these shortcomings, adding transparency, reproducibility, scalability, and reducing the potential for researcher bias. Current computational approaches to consumer healthcare discourse, however, tend to rely on simplified conceptualisations of language, prioritising lexis over grammar, and thus ignoring the central role played by grammar in the meaning\hyp{}making process.

%todo: foreground methods?
To address current methodological shortcomings in \gls{OSG} discourse research, this thesis presents an interdisciplinary, corpus\hyp{}based investigation of lexicogrammatical and discourse\hyp{}semantic choices made by members over the course of membership in an online bipolar disorder support community. 8.2 million words in over 66,000 posts from approximately 3,500 members were transformed into a metadata\hyp{}rich, grammatically annotated corpus and investigated from a systemic\hyp{}functional linguistic (SFL) perspective using purpose\hyp{}built corpus\slash computational linguistic tools. An analysis of \sctext{Mood} and \sctext{Modality} choices made over ten stages of membership highlights differences in the ways members negotiate role\hyp{}relationships, with changes in Mood Type, Modality and Speech Function reflecting a longitudinal increase in the provision of advice and social support. An analysis of the \sctext{Transitivity} system shows longitudinal changes in the kinds of participants and processes construed by Forum members, as well as changes in how these participants and processes behave lexicogrammatically. The \emph{diagnosis} Event, for example, is represented by newcomers as a process and modified temporally; at later stages of membership, it is more often reconstrued as a participant in discourse, framed in terms of veracity. Longitudinal shifts were also observed in the preferred ways of ascribing\slash attributing bipolar disorder to Forum members: new members use \emph{being} forms (\emph{I'm bipolar)}, while veteran members prefer \emph{having} constructions (\emph{I have bipolar}). 

The thesis has implications for corpus linguistics, systemic\hyp{}functional linguistic theory, and healthcare communication research. For corpus linguistics and corpus\hyp{}assisted discourse studies, the main contribution is \texttt{corpkit}, an open\hyp{}source software tool designed to build and analyse parsed and metadata\hyp{}rich corpora. it is suggested that the developed tools and methods can circumvent theoretically problematic current practices, and increase the accuracy and automatability of the analytical process. For healthcare communication research, the case study demonstrates the importance of expanding the conceptualisation and analysis of the consumer healthcare journey to include intra--consumer communication that occurs outside of hospitals and clinics. The thesis also advances an argument that the emerging field of clinical natural language processing stands to benefit from increased engagement with functional linguistic theory and insights generated within the qualitative paradigm. I argue that combining the insights from functional linguistics and discourse analysis with automated computational workflows is a step toward an important future goal of improvement of consumer health outcomes through analysis of large, digital collections of spoken and written healthcare discourse.

%The case study is also used to advance an argument for the use of computational linguistic and corpus-based approaches as an inexpensive and reliable complement to the increasing body of research focussed on analysing \gls{consumer} health talk and typologising the relationships between the settings in which these health-centred interactions occur.

Naturally, every manually categorised example could be disambiguated by contextualised reading---but the amount and kind of context needed varied widely.

New/expert status may affect 

To illustrate the point, let us imagine a hypothetical post from a new user, and a reply from a veteran user:

The lexicogrammar of the veteran's post itself tells us too little to determine whether past behaviour is being described, or whether advice is being offered. Reading the post before helps us some, but ambiguity remains, as two questions were asked, and a reply

As readers, we must decode the meaning with respect to our understanding of context of situation and context of culture. In this situation, we can see that the post is made by a veteran member. We know that veterans 

Even the most sophisticated querying of the corpus can only take us so far. We can count the relative frequency of modalisation, and identify which modals are subject to the most change. We can make lists of adjuncts and predicators that pattern with certain functions (\emph{I would never stop hurrying}; \emph{I would highly recommend medication})---but cases can still be imagined where \emph{I would never stop hurrying} is advice, and \emph{I would highly recommend medication} is a recount of habitual past behaviour. The less delicate the lexicogrammatical phenomenon of interest, the greater potential for incongruence or ambiguity. In a sense, this is a given, since the less delicate a phenomenon, the more potential realisations are possible. 

A further issue is whether advice is congruently realised as an imperative or a declarative. Imperatives/commands often carry a sense of high obligation, whereas declaratives simply provide information.

Provided advice is often non-binding, and it is understood that the one seeking advice is free to take or leave what he/she has received.

The extent to which advice is binding is dependent on the role relationships of the individuals: advice to a PhD candidate from his/her thesis examiner is likely to be treated as binding;

A tutor's advice to a classroom of students may be taken up by a few, but such advice given one-on-one during an office hour is much more likely to be seen by the student as obligatory. The inverse holds true, as well: a class of students providing fashion advice to their teacher are not offended if their teacher does not take up their suggestions.

Unequal role relationships between interlocutors shift the realisation of advice, with expertise in the field being discussed being a particularly salient determiner in the role relationship equivalence.

Expertise, in turn, may be realised through life experience, formal qualifications, etc.

%This needs to end up as a system network
